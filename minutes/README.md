# Weekly Minutes

Please write short descriptions about about
* DONE - What you did 
* TODO - What you intend to work on
* BLOCKER - Anything that's blocking your progress, which the organizers needs to be aware of
* RANDOM - Anything else you want to keep for the record

You do NOT need to fill everything, if it's not applicable for you.
